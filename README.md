# 🛒 Spring Boot Order-Product API

## 📌 Project Overview  
This mini-project is a **REST API** built with **Spring Boot** to demonstrate CRUD operations with proper architectural principles and best practices. 

### 🎯 **Use Case**

### 🚀 **CRUD Operations**  
- Admin can **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** products.  
- Clients can **place orders** and view their **order history**. 

### 🛠️ **Technical Objectives**
The project aims to demonstrate:
- **Best practices in Java**: Clean code, modular design, and clear separation of concerns.  
- **SOLID principles**
- **Use of `@Transactional`** for consistent database operations.
- **Pagination and sorting**
- **Dependency Injection:** Use of constructor-based injection for cleaner and testable code.  
- **Eror Handling:** Proper exception management with custom error responses.  
- **Design Patterns:** Implementation of patterns such as **Builder Pattern** (in this project create some object like product with builder even the use case doesnt need builder pattern).
